## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Feature Adoption
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive in-app promotion (notifications, onboarding)
- A/B test onboarding flows for highest completion rate
- Retargeting campaigns for users who viewed but didn't engage

**Contingency:** If <20% adoption by Day 30, increase paid media budget by $200K and launch influencer blitz

### Risk 2: Negative User Sentiment (Data Accuracy)
**Likelihood:** Low-Medium | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Clear attribution (verified vs. estimated)
- Prominent feedback mechanism for corrections
- Conservative rounding to avoid false precision

**Contingency:** Rapid response PR team, prioritize restaurant data corrections, transparency blog post

### Risk 3: Competitor Response (Uber Eats Copies)
**Likelihood:** High | **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize feature depth (they'll start with basic calories)
- Fast-follow with advanced features (integrations, premium tier)
- Lock in users with goal-setting (switching cost)

**Contingency:** Accelerate premium tier launch, expand B2B partnerships

### Risk 4: Restaurant Partner Backlash
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Frame nutrition transparency as marketing opportunity
- Show data: transparency increases average order value
- Make participation optional

**Contingency:** Delay expansion to new restaurants, focus on willing partners, PR emphasizing user demand
