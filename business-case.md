# Business Case: DoorDash Nutrition Tracking Feature

**Project:** Nutrition Tracking & Dietary Filters  
**Document Type:** Business Case & Financial Analysis  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 2025  
**Owner:** Product Management

---

## Executive Summary

### Opportunity
Health-conscious users represent 8% of DoorDash's active user base but contribute 18% of gross merchandise value (GMV). This high-LTV segment is churning at 1.6x the average rate due to lack of nutritional transparency, with many migrating to meal kit services like Factor or returning to home cooking.

### Proposed Solution
Launch a comprehensive nutrition tracking feature suite including per-item macro displays, real-time cart summaries, dietary filters, and optional macro goal setting.

### Financial Impact (12-Month Projection)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Incremental Revenue** | $12.4M |
| **Development Cost** | $890K |
| **Ongoing Costs (Year 1)** | $340K |
| **Net Financial Impact** | $11.2M |
| **ROI** | 910% |
| **Payback Period** | 2.1 months |

### Recommendation
**APPROVE** - This initiative delivers substantial financial returns while addressing a key competitive vulnerability and unlocking future monetization opportunities through premium health-focused features.

## Financial Projections

### Revenue Opportunity

#### 1. Churn Reduction
**Assumption:** 8% reduction in health segment churn

| Metric | Baseline | With Feature | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Annual churn rate (health) | 24% | 22.1% | -1.9pp |
| Users retained | - | 45,600 | - |
| Annual revenue per user | $1,650 | $1,650 | - |
| **Annual revenue saved** | - | - | **$75.2M** |

*Conservative discount applied: We attribute 10% of churn reduction ($7.5M) to this feature, acknowledging other factors.*

**Year 1 Revenue from Churn Reduction: $7.5M**

#### 2. Order Frequency Increase
**Assumption:** +13% order frequency for health segment users who adopt feature

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Feature adoption rate | 35% of health segment | 3.7M users |
| Baseline orders/month | 3.2 | 3.2 |
| New orders/month | 3.2 × 1.13 | 3.6 |
| Incremental orders/month | 0.4 per user | 0.4 |
| Total incremental orders/mo | 3.7M × 0.4 | 1.48M |
| Average order value | DoorDash take rate ~20% of $34.50 | $6.90 |
| **Monthly incremental revenue** | 1.48M × $6.90 | **$10.2M** |
| **Annual incremental revenue** | $10.2M × 12 | **$122.4M** |

*Conservative discount: Attribute 3% of frequency lift (rather than full 13%) due to seasonality and measurement uncertainty.*

**Year 1 Revenue from Frequency Increase: $28.4M**

*Note: 3% = $28.4M, calculated as: 3.7M users × 0.096 additional orders/month × 12 months × $6.90 revenue per order*

#### 3. New User Acquisition
**Assumption:** App Store featuring in "Health & Fitness" drives 2% lift in health-focused installs

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Monthly health-focused installs | 8% of 850K total | 68,000 |
| Incremental installs (2% lift) | 68,000 × 0.02 | 1,360 |
| First-year retained users (40%) | 1,360 × 0.40 × 12 months | 6,528 |
| Revenue per user (prorated) | $1,650 × 0.5 (half-year avg) | $825 |
| **Annual incremental revenue** | 6,528 × $825 | **$5.4M** |

*Conservative discount: Attribute 50% of lift to feature (other factors also drive ASO).*

**Year 1 Revenue from Acquisition: $2.7M**

#### 4. Basket Size Increase
**Assumption:** Users with macro goals spend +7% more per order to hit nutritional targets

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Users setting macro goals | 15% of 3.7M adopters | 555,000 |
| Orders per month | 3.6 | 3.6 |
| Baseline AOV | $34.50 | $34.50 |
| New AOV | $34.50 × 1.07 | $36.92 |
| Incremental GMV per order | $36.92 - $34.50 | $2.42 |
| DoorDash revenue per order | $2.42 × 20% | $0.48 |
| **Monthly incremental revenue** | 555K × 3.6 × $0.48 | **$960K** |
| **Annual incremental revenue** | $960K × 12 | **$11.5M** |

*Conservative discount: Attribute 30% of AOV lift to feature (users may add items for other reasons).*

**Year 1 Revenue from AOV Increase: $3.5M**

### Total Revenue Impact Summary

| Source | Year 1 | Year 2 (Est) | Year 3 (Est) |
|--------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Churn reduction | $7.5M | $10.2M | $12.8M |

## Risk-Adjusted Scenarios

### Conservative Case (70% Probability)
- Feature adoption: 25% (vs. 35% base)
- Frequency lift: 8% (vs. 13%)
- Churn reduction: 5% (vs. 8%)

**Net Impact:** $28.4M Year 1 | ROI: 2,328%

### Base Case (Expected - 20% Probability)
- As modeled above

**Net Impact:** $40.9M Year 1 | ROI: 3,495%

### Optimistic Case (10% Probability)
- Feature adoption: 45%
- Frequency lift: 18%
- Churn reduction: 12%
- Premium tier launch in Year 2 ($9.99/mo, 8% attach rate)

**Net Impact:** $58.6M Year 1 | $86.2M Year 2 (incl. premium)

### Weighted Expected Value
(70% × $28.4M) + (20% × $40.9M) + (10% × $58.6M) = **$34.0M Year 1**

**Even in conservative scenario, ROI exceeds 2,000%.**

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option A: Partner with MyFitnessPal for Integration
**Pros:** Lower development cost, leverage existing nutrition database  
**Cons:** Revenue share (30%), loss of control, data privacy concerns  
**Decision:** Rejected - strategic importance of owning the experience

### Option B: Acquire Meal Kit Company (e.g., Factor)
**Pros:** Instant credibility in health space, customer base  
**Cons:** $200-300M acquisition cost, operational complexity  
**Decision:** Rejected - not core competency, better to build

### Option C: Launch as Separate "DoorDash Health" App
**Pros:** Focused experience, clear positioning  
**Cons:** User fragmentation, higher CAC, loss of network effects  
**Decision:** Rejected - integrate into main app with progressive disclosure
