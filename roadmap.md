## Out of Scope (Intentionally Excluded)

The following features have been considered and intentionally excluded:

### Medical/Clinical Features
- Blood sugar tracking integrations (liability concerns)
- Prescription diet plan integration (requires medical licensing)
- Disease-specific meal plans (HIPAA, regulatory complexity)

**Rationale:** Avoid positioning as a medical tool; we're a food delivery platform with nutrition data.

### Gamification
- Points/badges for hitting macro goals
- Leaderboards, challenges, competitions

**Rationale:** Risk of encouraging unhealthy behaviors (restriction, comparison). Focus on information, not gamified motivation.

### Meal Kit / Ingredient Delivery
- Sell ingredients for users to cook
- Compete with Instacart/grocery delivery

**Rationale:** Separate business model, different operations. Partner rather than build.

### In-App Community Features
- Forums, user-to-user meal advice
- Social feed of meals

**Rationale:** Moderation complexity, low strategic value. Users have Reddit/Instagram for this.

---

## Appendix: Feature Backlog (Not Committed)

These are ideas under consideration but not yet scheduled:

### High Potential (Likely Future Inclusion)
- **Micronutrient tracking** (vitamins, minerals) - Data availability improving
- **Allergen warnings** - High safety value, moderate complexity
- **Voice ordering with nutrition constraints** - "Order me high-protein lunch under 600 cal"
- **Carbon footprint tracking** - Sustainability trend, differentiation opportunity

### Medium Potential (Needs Validation)
- **Meal photo nutrition estimation** - User uploads photo, we estimate macros
- **Group order macro summaries** - Show nutrition for entire group order
- **Nutrition "rewind"** - Suggest tomorrow's meals to balance yesterday's intake

### Low Potential (Parked for Now)
- **DNA-based meal recommendations** - Niche, accuracy unproven
- **Fasting timers** - Not core to delivery use case
- **Macro "banking"** - Save unused macros for later (encourages unhealthy restriction)

---

## Roadmap Review Cadence

- **Monthly:** Product leadership review - adjust priorities based on metrics
- **Quarterly:** Exec stakeholder review - confirm next quarter's committed features
- **Bi-annually:** Strategic reset - validate long-term vision, adjust themes

**Next review:** End of Q2 2025 (post-launch metrics evaluation)
